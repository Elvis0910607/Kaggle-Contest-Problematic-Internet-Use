# Kaggle-Contest-Problematic-Internet-Use

### Overview
In today's digital age, the issue of children's and adolescents' internet use has become a growing concern. The excessive use of technology devices can lead to significant consequences, particularly in relation to mental health, such as depression and anxiety. Additionally, physical habits such as poor posture, irregular eating habits, and decreased physical activity are common side effects of prolonged screen time.

The objective of this competition is to develop a predictive model that analyzes children's physical activity data alongside various psychological indices to identify early signs of problematic internet use. By recognizing these patterns, we aim to prevent the development of unhealthy digital habits at an early stage, leading to healthier digital engagement.

### Goal
The goal is to create a model that can predict the likelihood of problematic internet use in children and adolescents based on their physical activity data and psychological health metrics.

### Approach
To achieve this goal, participants will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization techniques and statistical tools. These methods will aid in effective feature engineering to improve the accuracy of the predictive model. Time-series data, such as physical activity indices and measurements from body health sensors, will be used to train a LightGBM model.

### Dataset
The dataset contains:
-Time-series data from body health measurements (e.g., physical activity levels).
-Psychological indices related to the childrenâ€™s mental health, including factors like mood and behavior.
-Demographic information (if available).

### Tools and Technologies
-Data Visualization: Use visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to explore the data.
-Statistical Analysis: Apply statistical methods to identify key trends and correlations in the data.
-LightGBM: This gradient boosting algorithm will be the main model used for classification.
-Python: Python will be the primary programming language for data processing, analysis, and model building.
